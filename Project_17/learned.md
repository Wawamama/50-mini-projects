# What I learned with this project

# More on fetch and API

# Destructuring
To extract properties of an object into variables :

const { property1, property2 } = object
// For the movie app : we have an object 'movie' with properties title, poster_path and others... :
-> const { title, poster_path } = movie
This creates a variable title with the value of movie.title and a variable poster_path with the value of movie.poster_path
